			Hey There!
			You seem pretty cool! I mean, you're looking under the hood of my website. You rock!

			There's not a whole lot to see here, other than some technical debt. It turns out if you make a website in college, it might stick with you much later into your life.
			
			If you're curious, I use a bunch of awesome open source stuff, that I promise was cutting edge at the time:
				- HTML Boilerplate
				- Verika Initializr
				- jQuery
				- Modernizr
				- Respond.js
				- Anchorjump
				- Google Webfonts
				- Track Everything (modified) 
			It also uses some cool software:
				- Google Analytics
			--
			Nick

				<p>Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Nick Quinlan</span>. I live in Seattle, WA and am <span itemprop="jobTitle">Chief Operating Officer</span> at <a href="http://mlh.io" itemprop>Major League Hacking</a>. Previously, I was a <a href="http://sendgrid.com">SendGrid</a> Developer Evangelist.</p>
				<p>I've been using (or more like been glued to) computers since the age of three, just ask my parents. At age five, I may have had one of the most well planned and marketed lemonade stands a five year old has ever had.</p>
				<img style="display: block; margin: 20px auto;" src="img/lemonade.jpg" alt="Nicholas Quinlan's Lemonade Stand" />
				<p>Since then, I've been using my love of technology, business, and lemonade to lead communities, educational initiatives, and technical organizations. </p>
